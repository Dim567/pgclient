## About

This is the official Wails React-TS template.

You can configure the project by editing `wails.json`. More information about the project settings can be found
here: https://wails.io/docs/reference/project-config

## Live Development

To run in live development mode, run `wails dev` in the project directory. This will run a Vite development
server that will provide very fast hot reload of your frontend changes. If you want to develop in a browser
and have access to your Go methods, there is also a dev server that runs on http://localhost:34115. Connect
to this in your browser, and you can call your Go code from devtools.

## Building

To build a redistributable, production mode package, use `wails build`.

## Issues

1. Can't delete database. Need to decide if this option should be provided to user.
2. Loaders icons are absent.
3. Inside results window table is scrollable. Need to make table header sticky in order to be able to see what data table cell represents.
4. Transactions is not supported.
